<h2 align="center">The Solution(s)</h2>
<p>
There exist three variations of the solution to this assignment. I purposely chose to include multiple scripts rather than merge the iterations into a single file to illustrate the different methodologies that were used. Please bear in mind that I am not an expert in Python programming. There are probably more elegant ways that I could have coded the solutions present, yet I may not have discovered these ways as I am still learning--I will get there in time (believe it :wink:).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>
      <h3><a href="battlegame1.py">Solution #1</a></h3>
      <p>I followed the directives precisely as they were provided. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
      <h3><a href="battlegame2.py">Solution #2</a></h3>
      <p>I attempted to implement an improved variation of the code using basic knowledge of data structures. Since the characters (e.g. Wizard, Elf, Human) shared common attributes, I tried to represent each character as a dictionary with the same properties (e.g name, health points, damage) but different values. In addition, I added the functionality of randomization for the simulated battles.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
      <h3><a href="battlegame3.py">Solution #3</a></h3>
      <p>It dawned on me--late in the game--that Python classes were the way to go. Thus, I refactored my code from <strong>Solution #2</strong> accordingly. There are additional features that I am developing, it will just take some time to get there.</p>
